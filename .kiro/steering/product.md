# Product Overview

## Financial Agent Desktop Demo

A two-stage demonstration web application showcasing the evolution from static financial-services agent desktops to dynamic AI-orchestrated interfaces.

## Purpose

Demonstrates how AI can intelligently orchestrate UI components based on conversation context, moving from a cluttered, always-visible interface to a clean, context-aware workspace.

## Key Features

- **Static View** (/static): Current-state agent desktop with all panels always visible (Customer Profile, Account Summary, Transaction History, Risk/Fraud Indicators, Previous Interactions, Telephony Controls, AI Assist Sidebar)
- **Dynamic View** (/dynamic): Future-state agent desktop with AI-driven contextual UI where tiles appear/disappear based on conversation context
- **Timeline-Driven**: Both demonstrations use JSON timeline files to sequence events (transcripts, AI reasoning, UI changes) without requiring real backend services
- **AI Activity Feed**: Displays AI reasoning, actions, and status updates in real-time
- **Auto-Populate**: AI-driven form field population with visual indicators
- **Mock Data Only**: No external APIs, authentication, or database required

## Target Audience

Stakeholders and developers evaluating AI-assisted agent desktop interfaces for financial services.
